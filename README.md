# Infinitranslate
I have a summer with nothing to do. So I coded. This is only the first of many goofy projects to come!
## Features
Infinitranslate uses the magic of AI to translate anything to literally anything you can think of.
Spanish, Chinese, Shakespeare, Pirate speak, lolcat, or anything else!
You can translate either full web pages in the website page or text samples on the text page.
## Setup and Usage
1. Create a file in the Infinitranslate folder with the name .env
2. Inside the file input the following:
GEMINI_KEY = 'YOUR KEY HERE'
(replace "YOUR KEY HERE" with your actual Gemini API key)
3. Open main.py and run with python interpreter. Use a web browser to navigate to the address that it is running on (stated in console). Enjoy!
